## Installation

### macOS

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/donggyushin/macmo/releases/latest/download/macmo.zip
unzip macmo.zip
mv macmo.app /Applications/
rm macmo.zip
echo "‚úÖ macmo installed successfully!"
```

**First Launch Instructions:**

Since macmo is not distributed through the App Store, macOS will block it by default. Follow these steps to open it:

1. **Try to open the app** - Double-click `macmo.app` in Applications folder
2. **macOS will block it** - You'll see a message saying the app "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
3. **Open System Settings** - Go to **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**
4. **Allow the app** - Scroll down to find the security message about macmo and click **"Open Anyway"**
5. **Confirm** - Click **"Open"** in the confirmation dialog

Alternatively, you can **right-click (or Control-click) the app** and select **"Open"**, then click **"Open"** in the dialog.

> **Note**: You only need to do this once. After the first launch, you can open macmo normally.


#### Manual Install

2. Unzip the file
3. Drag `macmo.app` to your Applications folder
4. **First launch only**: Follow the "First Launch Instructions" above to allow the app to run

### iCloud Sync
